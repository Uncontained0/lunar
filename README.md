# Lunar
**A simple and extendable lua parser written in lua.**

Lunar tokenizes and parses lua code into an abstract syntax
tree. This structure can be used for many purposes, like
code analysis, code generation, or even code transformation.

## Past Art

Lunar is heavily inspired by [full moon](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/full-moon).
Much of the logic is directly taken from full moon. If you
know rust, I highly suggest you check it out.

## Usage

This library can be installed via lit:

```bash
lit install luna-lua/lunar
```

There is currently no documentation for Lunar.
